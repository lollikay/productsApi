## REST
- list of products - GET https://mockend.com/lollikay/productsApi/products
- product details - GET https://mockend.com/lollikay/productsApi/products/<id>

POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests are mocked and changes aren't saved. 
You can therefore develop forms and make requests without polluting your 
initial dataset.
